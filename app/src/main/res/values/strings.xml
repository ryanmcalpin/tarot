    <string name="c2r">The two of cups when reversed can signify an imbalance or disharmony in life or in a partnership. It may mean a romantic relationship is heading toward dissolution or perhaps that it is one-sided and requires work to be balanced. The two of cups may also indicate self-love and focusing inward instead of on others. There may be a strong need for self-acceptance and self-respect.</string>
